-👋 Hi, I’m @hss2023happy
-👀 I’m interested in robotics, computer vision, and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).

-🌱 I’m currently learning advanced LiDAR-based SLAM algorithms and visual localization techniques.

-💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to autonomous navigation, point cloud processing, and sensor fusion.

-📫 How to reach me: [your email or other preferred contact, e.g., LinkedIn, personal site]

-😄 Pronouns: he/him (or specify yours)

-⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy solving algorithmic challenges and often prototype SLAM ideas in both C++ and MATLAB!
